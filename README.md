A swerve drive is a special type of drivetrain used in FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition). It allows each individual wheel to be powered and turned independent from the other wheels, giving it unparalleled maneuverability on the field. It has following features:  
  
- Independently steered drive modules
- Simple conceptually
- Simple wheels
- Good traction
- Complex to build
- Complex to program and control
- Maximum pushing force
- Either steered gearboxes or concentric drive
